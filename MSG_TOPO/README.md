# Multi-Scale Guided convolutional network (MSG)

## Hierarchy
- src <br>
  - depth_utils: original implementation from voyleg, could be potentially useful for further research regarding uncertainty, etc. Not used in this project though.
  - losses: original implementation from voyleg, could be potentially useful for further research regarding visaully favored loss function.
  - msg: backbone of the neural network.
