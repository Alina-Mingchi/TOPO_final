# PMBANet: Progressive Multi-Branch Aggregation Network for Scene Depth Super-Resolution

## Hierarchy
- Error_Plot_Distribution_beast.ipynb: <br>
  plot the error distribution
- Test_TOPO.ipynb: <br>
  test of TOPO dataset
- Test_simple_geometry.ipynb: <br>
  test of simple geometry dataset

- base_networks.py: <br>
  Backbone of the neral network, original implementation from the author of this paper, however, due to lack of documentation, a bit comfusing.
- data.py: <br>
  data preparation to get the correct input size and shape
- dataset.py: <br>
  data preparation to get patches, augmentation, and parsing to the neural network



## Note:
PMBA pretrained net is too large, need to download to local, but it is already trasferred to beast2020 computer.
